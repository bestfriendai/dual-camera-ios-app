# Dual Camera App - Testing & Deployment Guide

## 🔧 Recent Fixes (v2.1)

### Critical Crash Fix
**Issue:** EXC_BAD_ACCESS crash on launch (stuck at splash screen)

**Root Cause:**
- Camera sessions were being started before permissions were granted
- Initialization order was incorrect
- Missing safety guards on camera operations

**Solution:**
- ✅ Fixed initialization order: Permissions → Setup → Start
- ✅ Added `isSetupComplete` flag to prevent premature operations
- ✅ Made `setupCameras()` called only after permissions granted
- ✅ Added weak self references to prevent retain cycles
- ✅ Added safety guards to all camera methods
- ✅ Added background/foreground handling
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging
