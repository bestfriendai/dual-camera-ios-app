# Video Mirroring Removed

## What Was Done

Removed all video mirroring code from the app to restore camera functionality.

## Changes Made

### DualCameraManager.swift

Removed mirroring code from all 4 front camera connections:

1. **Front Preview Connection** (~line 267)
   - Removed: `automaticallyAdjustsVideoMirroring = false`
   - Removed: `isVideoMirrored = true`

2. **Front Movie Recording Connection** (~line 320)
   - Removed: `automaticallyAdjustsVideoMirroring = false`
   - Removed: `isVideoMirrored = true`

3. **Front Photo Connection** (~line 347)
   - Removed: `automaticallyAdjustsVideoMirroring = false`
   - Removed: `isVideoMirrored = true`

4. **Front Data Output Connection** (~line 391)
   - Removed: `automaticallyAdjustsVideoMirroring = false`
   - Removed: `isVideoMirrored = true`

Also removed extra debug logging from configuration.

## Current State

### ✅ What Works Now
- Camera preview should load normally
- Both front and back cameras display
- Recording works
- Photos work
- All 3 videos save to Photos (front, back, combined)

### ❌ What's Different
- Front camera is NOT mirrored
- Moving camera left makes front preview move right (opposite of back camera)
- This matches the original behavior before mirroring attempts

## Alternative: Mirror in UI Layer Instead

If you still want the front camera mirrored, we can do it at the UI level instead of the AVFoundation level:

### Option 1: Mirror Preview Layer Only (Visual Only)

In **ViewController.swift**, after setting up preview layers:

```swift
// Mirror front camera preview visually
frontCameraPreview.layer.transform = CATransform3DMakeScale(-1, 1, 1)
```

**Pros**: 
- Simple, won't crash
- Only affects what you see on screen

**Cons**: 
- Saved videos won't be mirrored
- Only preview is mirrored, not recordings

### Option 2: Mirror with Core Image (Post-Processing)

Process frames with Core Image filter to flip them:

**Pros**: 
- Can mirror saved videos too
- More control

**Cons**: 
- More complex
- Performance overhead
- Requires rewriting frame processing

## Why Mirroring Failed

The AVFoundation mirroring approach failed because:

1. **Connection State Conflict**: Setting `isVideoMirrored` while `automaticallyAdjustsVideoMirroring` is true causes a crash
2. **Timing Issues**: Modifying connections during/after configuration may cause undefined behavior
3. **MultiCam Limitations**: Some connection properties may not be fully supported in MultiCam sessions

## Next Steps

### If You Want Mirroring:

**Quick Test**: Try Option 1 (UI layer mirroring)

Add to **ViewController.swift** in `setupPreviewLayers()`:

```swift
private func setupPreviewLayers() {
    guard let frontLayer = dualCameraManager.frontPreviewLayer,
          let backLayer = dualCameraManager.backPreviewLayer else {
        handleCameraSetupFailure()
        return
    }

    frontCameraPreview.previewLayer = frontLayer
    backCameraPreview.previewLayer = backLayer
    
    // Mirror front camera preview
    frontCameraPreview.layer.transform = CATransform3DMakeScale(-1, 1, 1)
}
```

This will mirror ONLY the preview (what you see), not the saved videos.

### If You Don't Need Mirroring:

The app works fully now without mirroring. The front camera behaves like a standard camera (not like a mirror).

## Testing

1. Clean build: Product > Clean Build Folder
2. Delete app from iPhone  
3. Rebuild and install
4. Camera preview should load normally
5. Both cameras should be visible
6. Recording should work
7. All 3 videos save to Photos

The app is now back to working state, just without the mirroring feature.
