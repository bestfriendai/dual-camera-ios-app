## Key Components

### DualCameraManager
The heart of the app that manages:
- Dual camera session setup and configuration
- Video recording from both cameras
- Audio capture from the front camera
- Preview layer management
- Recording state management

### ViewController
Main interface that provides:
- Dual camera preview displays
- Recording controls and status
- User interaction handling
- Video merging interface

### VideoMerger
Video processing functionality:
- Side-by-side video composition
- Audio synchronization
- High-quality video export
- Photos library integration

## Usage

### Recording Videos
1. Launch the app and grant camera/microphone permissions
2. (Optional) Tap the quality button (top-right) to select video quality (720p, 1080p, or 4K)
3. Position yourself to get the desired front and back camera views
4. Use pinch gestures to zoom in/out on either camera view
5. Tap on camera previews to set focus and exposure points
6. Tap the record button to begin simultaneous recording
7. Tap the stop button when finished
8. Videos are automatically saved to the app's documents directory

### Merging Videos
1. After recording, tap "Merge Videos"
2. Select your preferred layout:
   - **Side-by-Side**: Both cameras shown equally side-by-side
   - **Picture-in-Picture**: Back camera as main view with front camera as small overlay
3. Watch the progress bar as the app processes and combines both recordings
4. The merged video will be automatically saved to your Photos library
5. Old temporary files are cleaned up automatically

### Managing Videos
1. Tap the gallery button (top-left) to open the video gallery
2. Browse all your recorded and merged videos
3. Tap any video to:
   - **Play**: Watch the video in full-screen player
   - **Share**: Share via Messages, Mail, AirDrop, etc.
   - **Delete**: Remove the video from storage

### Camera Controls

## Permissions Required

The app requires the following permissions (automatically requested):

- **Camera Access**: For recording from front and back cameras
- **Microphone Access**: For audio recording
- **Photo Library Access**: For saving merged videos

## Implementation Details

### Camera Session Management
- Separate `AVCaptureSession` instances for each camera
- Audio input attached only to the front camera session
- `AVCaptureMovieFileOutput` for direct video file recording
