## Settings System

### Overview

The settings system provides a comprehensive solution for managing app preferences with support for local storage, cloud synchronization, validation, and migration.

### Components

#### SettingsManager

`SettingsManager` is an actor that manages the app's settings. It provides:

- Local storage of settings
- Cloud synchronization via CloudKit
- Settings validation
- Settings migration between versions
- Import/export functionality

Key methods:
- `getSettings()` - Retrieves current settings
- `updateSettings(_:)` - Updates settings
- `resetToDefaults()` - Resets settings to defaults
- `exportSettings()` - Exports settings to data
- `importSettings(from:)` - Imports settings from data
- `enableCloudSync(_:)` - Enables/disables cloud sync

#### SettingsValidator

`SettingsValidator` is an actor that validates settings and handles migration between versions.

Key methods:
- `validate(_:)` - Validates settings
- `migrate(_:from:)` - Migrates settings from one version to another
- `sanitize(_:)` - Sanitizes settings to ensure valid values

#### Settings Models

The settings system includes several model types:

- `UserSettings` - Main settings container

- `AudioSettings` - Audio-related settings
- `VideoSettings` - Video-related settings
- `UISettings` - UI-related settings
- `PerformanceSettings` - Performance-related settings
- `GeneralSettings` - General app settings

#### Settings UI

The settings UI is built with SwiftUI and uses the liquid glass design system:

- `SettingsView` - Main settings view
- `SettingsViewModel` - View model for settings
- `SettingsSectionViews` - Individual settings section views
- Various reusable components like `SettingsToggleView`, `SettingsSliderView`, etc.

### Features

- **Cloud Sync**: Settings can be synchronized across devices using CloudKit
- **Validation**: Settings are validated before being saved
- **Migration**: Settings can be migrated between app versions
- **Import/Export**: Settings can be exported to and imported from files
- **Liquid Glass UI**: Beautiful glass-morphism UI with animations

## Error Handling System

### Overview

The error handling system provides a comprehensive solution for managing errors throughout the app, including error reporting, recovery, and UI components.

### Components

#### ErrorHandlingManager

`ErrorHandlingManager` is an actor that manages errors throughout the app. It provides:

- Error collection and storage
- Error categorization and severity assessment
- Error recovery strategies
- Error reporting and analytics
- Error history management

Key methods:
- `handleError(_:context:severity:)` - Handles an error
- `handleCriticalError(_:context:)` - Handles a critical error
- `dismissError(_:)` - Dismisses an error
- `generateErrorReport()` - Generates an error report

#### Error Models

The error handling system includes several model types:

- `ErrorRecord` - Represents an error with context and metadata
- `ErrorContext` - Provides context for where an error occurred
- `ErrorReport` - A report of errors over a time period
- `DiagnosticIssue` - Represents an issue detected by diagnostics

#### Error UI

The error UI is built with SwiftUI and uses the liquid glass design system:

- `ErrorView` - Modal error view
- `ErrorBannerView` - Banner error view
- `ErrorModalView` - Full-screen modal error view
- `ErrorRecoveryView` - Error recovery view
- `ErrorReportView` - Error report view

### Features

- **Error Categorization**: Errors are categorized by type and severity
- **Error Recovery**: The system can attempt to recover from certain errors
- **Error Reporting**: Comprehensive error reports can be generated
- **Error History**: A history of errors is maintained
- **Liquid Glass UI**: Beautiful glass-morphism UI with animations

## Diagnostics System

### Overview

The diagnostics system provides comprehensive monitoring of the app's performance and health, including system metrics, performance metrics, and app metrics.

### Components

#### DiagnosticsManager

`DiagnosticsManager` is an actor that manages diagnostics and monitoring. It provides:

- System metrics collection (CPU, memory, battery, etc.)
- Performance metrics collection (frame rate, render time, etc.)
- App metrics collection (uptime, sessions, etc.)
- Diagnostic report generation
- System health checks

Key methods:
- `collectMetrics()` - Collects current metrics
- `generateDiagnosticReport()` - Generates a diagnostic report
- `runSystemHealthCheck()` - Runs a system health check
- `exportDiagnosticData()` - Exports diagnostic data

#### Diagnostic Models

The diagnostics system includes several model types:

- `PerformanceMetrics` - Performance-related metrics
- `SystemMetrics` - System-related metrics
- `AppMetrics` - App-related metrics
- `DiagnosticReport` - A comprehensive diagnostic report
- `SystemHealthCheck` - Results of a system health check

#### Diagnostic UI

The diagnostic UI is built with SwiftUI and uses the liquid glass design system:

- `DiagnosticReportView` - View for displaying diagnostic reports

### Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of system and app metrics
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health checks for various system components
- **Issue Detection**: Automatic detection of performance and system issues
- **Recommendations**: Recommendations for resolving detected issues
- **Export**: Diagnostic data can be exported for analysis

## Integration

### AppState

`AppState` is the main app state object that integrates all the systems:

- Manages the app's overall state
- Coordinates between the settings, error handling, and diagnostics systems
- Provides convenience methods for common operations
- Manages UI state for errors, loading, etc.

### Error Handling Integration

Error handling is integrated throughout the app:

- All managers use the error handling system to report errors
- The app state handles error display and recovery
- Global error handling is set up for uncaught exceptions

### Settings Integration

Settings are integrated throughout the app:

- All components can access and update settings
- Settings changes are validated and synchronized
- Settings are used to configure app behavior

### Diagnostics Integration

Diagnostics are integrated throughout the app:

- System metrics are continuously collected
- Performance issues are automatically detected
- Diagnostic reports can be generated on demand

## Testing

### Test Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

- Unit tests for all managers and models
- UI tests for all views
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance tests for critical operations

### Test Files

- `ComprehensiveTests.swift` - Contains all test cases
- Mock objects are provided for testing
- Test utilities are provided for creating test data

### Running Tests

To run the tests:

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the test target
3. Run the tests using the test navigator or cmd+U

## Usage Examples

### Settings

```swift
// Get current settings
let settings = await SettingsManager.shared.getSettings()

// Update a setting
var newSettings = settings
newSettings.cameraSettings.defaultCameraPosition = .front
try await SettingsManager.shared.updateSettings(newSettings)

// Reset to defaults
try await SettingsManager.shared.resetToDefaults()

// Export settings
let data = try await SettingsManager.shared.exportSettings()

// Import settings
try await SettingsManager.shared.importSettings(from: data)
```

### Error Handling

```swift
// Handle an error
await ErrorHandlingManager.shared.handleError(
    error,
    context: ErrorContext(component: "MyComponent", operation: "MyOperation"),
    severity: .error
)

// Get active errors
let activeErrors = await ErrorHandlingManager.shared.getActiveErrors()

// Generate an error report
let report = await ErrorHandlingManager.shared.generateErrorReport()
```

### Diagnostics

```swift
// Collect metrics
await DiagnosticsManager.shared.collectMetrics()

// Generate a diagnostic report
let report = await DiagnosticsManager.shared.generateDiagnosticReport()

// Run a system health check
let healthCheck = await DiagnosticsManager.shared.runSystemHealthCheck()

// Export diagnostic data
let data = await DiagnosticsManager.shared.exportDiagnosticData()
```

### UI

```swift
// Show settings
SettingsView()

// Show an error
ErrorView(
    errorRecord: errorRecord,
    onDismiss: { /* Handle dismiss */ },
    onRetry: { /* Handle retry */ }
)

// Show a diagnostic report
DiagnosticReportView(report: report)
```
