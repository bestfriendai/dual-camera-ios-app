EnhancedGlassmorphismView.initialize()
AdvancedMaterialSystem.initialize()
DesignSystem.initialize()
EnhancedColorSystem.initialize()
AccessibilitySystem.shared.initialize()
FocusModeIntegration.shared.initialize()
MotorAccessibilityFeatures.shared.initialize()
```

2. **Apply Design System**
```swift
// Apply design system to your views
let label = DesignSystem.createLabel(
    text: "Hello World",
    typography: .title1,
    color: .primary
)

let button = DesignSystem.createButton(
    title: "Tap Me",
    style: .primary
)
```

3. **Use Material Components**
```swift
// Use material components for consistent styling
let container = AdvancedMaterialSystem.createProminentContainer()
let button = AdvancedMaterialSystem.createMaterialButton(
    title: "Action",
    style: .primary
)
```

### Advanced Integration

For more advanced integration:

1. **Customize Glassmorphism**
```swift
// Create custom glassmorphism views
let glassView = EnhancedGlassmorphismView(
    material: .systemThickMaterial,
    vibrancy: .primary,
    adaptiveBlur: true,
    depthEffect: true
)
```

2. **Implement Contextual Controls**
```swift
// Implement contextual controls for different modes
let controls = ContextualControlsView()
controls.updateUIForMode(.video)
```

3. **Add Gesture Shortcuts**
```swift
// Add gesture shortcuts for common actions
let gestureManager = GestureShortcutManager.shared
gestureManager.setupGestureShortcuts(on: view)
```

4. **Implement Accessibility**
```swift
// Implement accessibility features
AccessibilitySystem.shared.setupAccessibilityForView(view)
MotorAccessibilityFeatures.shared.setupSwitchControlScanning()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Use the design system and material components for consistent styling
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure all UI elements are accessible with proper labels and hints
3. **Performance**: Optimize animations and visual effects for smooth performance
4. **User Experience**: Provide clear feedback for all interactions with haptic and visual feedback
5. **Testing**: Test with different accessibility settings and assistive technologies
