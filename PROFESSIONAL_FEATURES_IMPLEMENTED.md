## üéì Developer Notes

### Adding More Features

To add additional professional features, follow this pattern:

```swift
// 1. Add configuration method
private func configureNewFeature(for device: AVCaptureDevice?, position: String) {
    guard let device = device else { return }
    
    do {
        try device.lockForConfiguration()
        
        // Configure feature
        if device.supportsFeature {
            device.enableFeature()
            print("DEBUG: ‚úÖ Feature enabled for \(position)")
        }
        
        device.unlockForConfiguration()
    } catch {
        print("DEBUG: ‚ö†Ô∏è Error: \(error)")
    }
}

// 2. Call from configureCameraProfessionalFeatures()
configureNewFeature(for: frontCamera, position: "Front")
configureNewFeature(for: backCamera, position: "Back")
```

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check Console Output**
   - Look for "DEBUG: ‚úÖ" = success
   - Look for "DEBUG: ‚ö†Ô∏è" = warning
   - Look for "DEBUG: ‚ÑπÔ∏è" = info

2. **Verify in Finder**
   - Check file extensions (.mov)
   - Check file sizes (smaller with H.265)
   - QuickTime Info shows codec

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Use Instruments for thermal tracking
   - Monitor frame drops during recording
   - Check CPU usage with H.265 encoding

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Videos are still large files**
A: Check console for "Using H.265/HEVC codec" message. If not present, device may not support it (iOS 10 or earlier).

**Q: Stabilization not working**
A: Ensure `isVideoStabilizationSupported` returns true. Some simulated devices don't support it.

**Q: Center Stage not activating**
A: Center Stage is primarily for iPad. Check device compatibility and iOS version (15.4+).

**Q: HDR looks washed out**
A: Some displays don't support HDR playback. Try viewing on iPhone/iPad screen or HDR-capable monitor.
