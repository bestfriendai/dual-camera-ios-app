# Dual Camera iOS App - Release Notes v2.1

## üéâ Version 2.1 - Critical Stability Update

**Release Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Stable | ‚úÖ Production Ready  
**Build:** Successful

---

## üö® Critical Fix: EXC_BAD_ACCESS Crash Resolved

### The Problem
Users reported the app was crashing immediately on launch with an `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` error, causing the app to freeze at the splash screen. This was a critical issue preventing any use of the application.

### Root Cause Analysis
After thorough investigation, we identified multiple initialization issues:

1. **Premature Camera Access**: Camera sessions were being started before permissions were granted
2. **Incorrect Initialization Order**: `setupCameras()` was called in `init()` before the view controller was ready
3. **Missing Safety Guards**: No checks to prevent operations on uninitialized camera sessions
4. **Retain Cycles**: Strong references in closures causing memory issues
5. **No Lifecycle Management**: App didn't handle background/foreground transitions

### The Solution
We completely rebuilt the initialization flow with proper architecture:

```
Old Flow (Broken):
Init ‚Üí Setup Cameras ‚Üí Start Sessions ‚Üí Request Permissions ‚ùå

New Flow (Fixed):
Init ‚Üí Request Permissions ‚Üí Setup Cameras ‚Üí Start Sessions ‚úÖ
```

## üîß Technical Changes

### 1. Camera Initialization Refactor

**DualCameraManager.swift:**
```swift
// Added setup completion flag
private var isSetupComplete = false

// Made setupCameras() public and safe
func setupCameras() {
    guard !isSetupComplete else { return }
    // ... setup code ...
    isSetupComplete = true
}

// Added safety guards to all operations
func startSessions() {
    guard isSetupComplete else {
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot start sessions - setup not complete")
        return
    }
    // ... start code ...
}
```

**Impact:** Prevents any camera operations before proper initialization

### 2. ViewController Initialization Order

**ViewController.swift:**
```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    setupUI()                    // 1. Setup UI first
    setupNotifications()         // 2. Setup lifecycle handlers
    requestCameraPermissions()   // 3. Request permissions last
}

private func setupCamerasAfterPermissions() {
    dualCameraManager.setupCameras()  // Only after permissions granted
    setupDualCamera()
    isCameraSetupComplete = true
    dualCameraManager.startSessions()
}
```

**Impact:** Ensures proper initialization sequence

### 3. Memory Management Improvements

**Added weak references:**
```swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async { [weak self] in
    guard let self = self else { return }
    // ... safe operations ...
}
```

**Added cleanup:**
```swift
deinit {
    NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self)
}
```

**Impact:** Prevents retain cycles and memory leaks

### 4. Background/Foreground Handling

**New lifecycle management:**
```swift
@objc private func appWillResignActive() {
    if isRecording {
        dualCameraManager.stopRecording()
    }
    if isCameraSetupComplete {
        dualCameraManager.stopSessions()
    }
}

@objc private func appDidBecomeActive() {
    if isCameraSetupComplete {
        dualCameraManager.startSessions()
    }
}
```

**Impact:** Prevents crashes when app is backgrounded

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling

**Added safety checks throughout:**
- Camera device availability checks
- Session setup completion checks
- Permission status verification
- Resource availability validation

**Impact:** Graceful degradation instead of crashes
