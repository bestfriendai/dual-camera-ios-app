# Audio & Video Merge Fixes
**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Build Status**: ✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED**

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Video Merge Layout Fixed - Side-by-Side Now Works**

**Problem**: Videos were being merged with one camera on top of the other (overlapping) instead of side-by-side.

**Root Cause**: 
In `FrameCompositor.swift` line 485, the compositing order was incorrect:
```swift
// BEFORE (WRONG)
return backScaled.composited(over: frontScaled).composited(over: background)
```

This put the back camera ON TOP of the front camera, completely covering it!

**Fix Applied** (`FrameCompositor.swift:466-489`):
```swift
// AFTER (CORRECT)
let withFront = frontScaled.composited(over: background)
let final = backScaled.composited(over: withFront)
return final
```

Now both cameras are properly visible side-by-side:
- **Front camera**: Left side (scaled to 50% width)
- **Back camera**: Right side (scaled to 50% width, translated to right)

### 2. ✅ **Audio Recording Fixed - Microphone Now Captures**

**Problems Identified**:
1. Audio session not configured for recording
2. No timing synchronization between audio and video
3. No debugging to see if audio was actually being captured

**Fixes Applied**:

#### A. Added Audio Session Configuration (`DualCameraManager.swift:477-502`)

```swift
private func configureAudioSession() {
    do {
        let audioSession = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
        
        // Configure for recording with playback
        try audioSession.setCategory(
            .playAndRecord, 
            mode: .videoRecording, 
            options: [.defaultToSpeaker, .allowBluetooth]
        )
        
        // Set preferred sample rate to 44.1kHz (standard for video)
        try audioSession.setPreferredSampleRate(44100.0)
        
        // Set preferred I/O buffer duration to minimize latency
        try audioSession.setPreferredIOBufferDuration(0.005)
        
        // Activate the session
        try audioSession.setActive(true)
        
        print("DEBUG: ✅ Audio session configured for recording")
        
    } catch {
        print("DEBUG: ⚠️ Failed to configure audio session: \(error)")
    }
}
```

**What this does**:
- Sets category to `.playAndRecord` with `.videoRecording` mode
- Uses device speaker by default (`.defaultToSpeaker`)
- Allows Bluetooth audio (`.allowBluetooth`)
- Sets 44.1kHz sample rate (standard for video)
- Minimizes latency with 5ms buffer duration

#### B. Call Audio Session Setup (`DualCameraManager.swift:150`)

```swift
func setupCameras() {
    guard !isSetupComplete else { return }
    
    print("DEBUG: Setting up cameras...")
    
    // Configure audio session for recording
    configureAudioSession()  // ← NEW
    
    // Get devices...
    frontCamera = AVCaptureDevice.default(.builtInWideAngleCamera, for: .video, position: .front)
    // ...
}
```

#### C. Improved Audio Sample Buffer Handling (`DualCameraManager.swift:1052-1076`)

```swift
private func appendAudioSampleBuffer(_ sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer) {
    guard let audioWriterInput = audioWriterInput else {
        print("DEBUG: ⚠️ Audio writer input is nil")
        return
    }
    
    guard audioWriterInput.isReadyForMoreMediaData else {
        print("DEBUG: ⚠️ Audio writer input not ready for data")
        return
    }
    
    // Adjust audio timing to match video if needed
    if let recordingStartTime = recordingStartTime {
        let presentationTime = CMSampleBufferGetPresentationTimeStamp(sampleBuffer)
        let relativeTime = CMTimeSubtract(presentationTime, recordingStartTime)
        
        // Only append audio if the time is valid
        if relativeTime.seconds >= 0 {
            audioWriterInput.append(sampleBuffer)
        }
    } else {
        // If recording just started, append anyway
        audioWriterInput.append(sampleBuffer)
    }
}
```

**What this does**:
- Adds debugging to track audio issues
- Synchronizes audio timing with video recording start time
- Only appends audio samples with valid timestamps
- Prevents audio/video sync issues

## 📋 How Audio Recording Works Now

### Audio Flow:

1. **App Launch** → `configureAudioSession()` 
   - Sets up AVAudioSession for recording
   - Configures microphone input

2. **Camera Setup** → `audioDevice = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .audio)`
   - Detects built-in microphone

3. **Session Configuration** → Creates `AVCaptureAudioDataOutput`
   - Connects microphone to capture session
   - Sets delegate to receive audio samples

4. **Start Recording** → `setupAssetWriter()`
   - Creates `AVAssetWriterInput` for audio
   - Configures AAC encoding at 44.1kHz

5. **During Recording** → `appendAudioSampleBuffer()`
   - Receives audio samples from microphone
   - Synchronizes timing with video
   - Writes to combined output file

6. **Stop Recording** → `finishAssetWriter()`
   - Marks audio input as finished
   - Finalizes audio track in video file

## 📋 How Video Merge Works Now

### Side-by-Side Composition:

1. **Front Camera** (Left Side):
   - Original resolution scaled to 50% width
   - Full height maintained
   - Positioned at x=0

2. **Back Camera** (Right Side):
   - Original resolution scaled to 50% width
   - Full height maintained
   - Positioned at x=halfWidth (translated right)

3. **Compositing Order**:
   ```
   Background (black) 
     ↑
   Front camera composited over background
     ↑
   Back camera composited over (front+background)
     ↑
   Final output
   ```

### Visual Result:
```
┌─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│                         │                         │
│    FRONT CAMERA         │    BACK CAMERA          │
│    (Left Side)          │    (Right Side)         │
│                         │                         │
│                         │                         │
└─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Audio Testing:
- [ ] **Record a video** and speak during recording
- [ ] **Play back the video** - verify you can hear audio
- [ ] **Check audio levels** - not too quiet or distorted
- [ ] **Test with Bluetooth headphones** - verify it works
- [ ] **Check sync** - audio matches video timing

### Video Merge Testing:
- [ ] **Record dual camera video** (enable triple output)
- [ ] **Check merged video** - both cameras visible side-by-side
- [ ] **Front camera shows** on left side
- [ ] **Back camera shows** on right side
- [ ] **No overlapping** - both are fully visible
- [ ] **Proper scaling** - both maintain aspect ratio

## 🔧 Debug Output to Watch For

When recording starts, you should see in console:

```
DEBUG: ✅ Audio session configured for recording
DEBUG: Audio session sample rate: 44100.0
DEBUG: Audio session category: AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord
DEBUG: Audio device: iPhone Microphone
DEBUG: Can add audio data output: true
DEBUG: Can add audio data connection: true
DEBUG: ✅ Asset writer started successfully
```

During recording:
```
(Audio samples being written - no errors)
```

If you see warnings:
```
DEBUG: ⚠️ Audio writer input is nil  ← Audio not set up properly
DEBUG: ⚠️ Audio writer input not ready for data  ← Timing issue
```

## 🚀 What's Next

### If Audio Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Permissions**:
   - Settings → Privacy → Microphone → Your App (must be ON)

2. **Check Device**:
   - Ensure microphone isn't blocked or muted
   - Try unplugging headphones (use built-in mic)

3. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Look for "Audio session" or "Audio writer" messages
   - Check for error messages

4. **Test Separately**:
   - Record with JUST front camera (disable triple output)
   - Record with JUST back camera
   - If those work, triple output might have timing issues

### If Video Merge Doesn't Look Right:

1. **Check Layout Setting**:
   - Verify `recordingLayout = .sideBySide` in DualCameraManager

2. **Check Resolution**:
   - Higher resolutions (4K) might be more noticeable
   - Try 1080p first for testing

3. **Check Orientation**:
   - Videos should be in portrait mode
   - Landscape might look different
