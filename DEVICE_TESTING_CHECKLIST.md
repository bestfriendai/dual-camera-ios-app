## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Physical Device Deployment**: Deploy to iPhone 17 Pro Max for camera testing
2. **Core Feature Verification**: Test dual camera recording functionality
3. **Performance Validation**: Monitor resource usage during recording
4. **Gallery Testing**: Verify video merging and playback

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Build for physical device
xcodebuild -project DualCameraApp.xcodeproj -scheme DualCameraApp -destination "platform=iOS,id=D4F7BEB2-1E77-5D04-80A6-684DE7B0A19E" build

# Install and run on device
xcrun devicectl device install app --device D4F7BEB2-1E77-5D04-80A6-684DE7B0A19E /path/to/app.ipa

# Monitor device logs
xcrun devicectl device log stream --device D4F7BEB2-1E77-5D04-80A6-684DE7B0A19E
```

## Success Criteria
- All core camera functions work without crashes
- Video recording and merging complete successfully
- Performance remains acceptable during extended use
- UI is responsive and animations are smooth
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully

## Known Limitations
- Simulator cannot test actual camera hardware
- Dual camera functionality requires physical device with multiple cameras
- Performance characteristics differ between simulator and device
- Some iOS features behave differently on simulator vs device
