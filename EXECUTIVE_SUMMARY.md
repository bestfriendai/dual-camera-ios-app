## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well
- **Functional dual camera recording** using AVCaptureMultiCamSession
- **Video merging capabilities** with side-by-side and PIP layouts
- **Basic glassmorphism UI** with UIVisualEffectView
- **Quality options** (720p, 1080p, 4K)
- **Camera controls** (zoom, focus, flash)
- **Video gallery** with playback and sharing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Needing Improvement
- **Slow startup** (~2-3 seconds to camera ready)
- **Limited output options** (only 2 separate files, manual merge)
- **Basic UI design** (not leveraging iOS 18+ features)
- **iOS 15.0 target** (missing 3 years of iOS improvements)
- **No real-time composition** (merge happens post-recording)
- **Synchronous initialization** (blocks main thread)

### üìä Technical Debt
- UIKit-only (no SwiftUI)
- Limited test coverage
- No performance monitoring
- Basic error handling
- No analytics or crash reporting
