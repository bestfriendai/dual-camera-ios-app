# Video Saving to iPhone Photo Library - Fixed

## Issues Found

1. **Individual videos (front & back) were NOT being saved to Photos**
   - Only the merged video was being saved
   - Front and back camera recordings stayed in app's Documents folder

2. **Combined/merged video was only saved when using VideoMerger manually**
   - Triple output combined video wasn't being saved automatically

## Changes Made

### 1. DualCameraManager.swift

#### Added Photos Framework Import
```swift
import Photos
```

#### Added Photo Library Saving Method
- New `saveVideoToPhotosLibrary(url:)` method that:
  - Requests photo library authorization
  - Saves videos using `PHAssetChangeRequest`
  - Handles all authorization states properly
  - Logs success/failure for debugging

#### Modified Recording Delegate
- `fileOutput(_:didFinishRecordingTo:)` now calls `saveVideoToPhotosLibrary()` for each completed recording
- This saves BOTH front and back camera videos individually to Photos

#### Modified Triple Output Completion
- `finishAssetWriter()` now saves the combined video to Photos when complete
- Combined video is saved automatically after recording stops

### 2. ViewController.swift

#### Enabled Triple Output Mode
```swift
dualCameraManager.enableTripleOutput = true
dualCameraManager.tripleOutputMode = .allFiles
```

This ensures the app records and saves:
- ✅ Front camera video (saved to Photos)
- ✅ Back camera video (saved to Photos)  
- ✅ Combined/merged video (saved to Photos)

## What Gets Saved Now

When you record a video, **THREE videos are saved to your iPhone Photo Library**:

1. **Front Camera Video** - `front_[timestamp].mov`
2. **Back Camera Video** - `back_[timestamp].mov`
3. **Combined Video** - `combined_[timestamp].mp4` (side-by-side or PiP layout)

## Permissions

The app already has the correct permissions in Info.plist:
- `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` - For saving videos
- `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` - For accessing photo library
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` - For camera access
- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` - For audio recording

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Record a video on physical iPhone
- [ ] Check Photos app for 3 new videos:
  - [ ] Front camera video
  - [ ] Back camera video  
  - [ ] Combined side-by-side video
- [ ] Verify all videos play correctly in Photos
- [ ] Verify videos have proper metadata (date, location if enabled)

## Technical Details

### Triple Output Mode Options

The app uses `TripleOutputMode.allFiles` which:
- Records individual front/back camera streams using `AVCaptureMovieFileOutput`
- Simultaneously composites frames using `FrameCompositor` for real-time combined output
- Saves all three files to Photos library
- Keeps temporary copies in Documents folder (cleaned up periodically)

### Video Formats

- **Individual videos**: `.mov` format (native iOS format)
- **Combined video**: `.mp4` format with H.264 codec
- **Audio**: AAC codec, 44.1kHz, stereo

### Storage Management

- Temporary files are kept in Documents folder
- Photos app makes its own copy when saving
- Temporary files are cleaned up after 7 days by `VideoMerger.cleanupOldTemporaryFiles()`
- Storage monitoring alerts user when space is low
