---

## üöÄ Testing Checklist

### Step 1: Launch the App
1. **Find the app** on Patrick's iPhone (look for "Dual Camera" icon)
2. **Tap to open** the app
3. You should see:
   - Two black preview boxes (front camera + back camera)
   - A red record button at the bottom
   - Quality button (top right)
   - Gallery button (top left)

### Step 2: Grant Permissions (CRITICAL!)
When you first open the app, you'll be asked for permissions:

1. **Camera Permission** - Tap "OK" or "Allow"
   - This lets the app access both cameras
   
2. **Microphone Permission** - Tap "OK" or "Allow"
   - This lets the app record audio
   
3. **Photos Permission** - Tap "Allow" or "Allow Access to All Photos"
   - This lets the app save merged videos

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** If you accidentally tap "Don't Allow", go to:
Settings ‚Üí Dual Camera ‚Üí Enable Camera, Microphone, and Photos

### Step 3: Test Camera Previews
After granting permissions, you should see:
- **Top preview box** = Live view from one camera (back camera by default)
- **Bottom preview box** = Live view from other camera (front camera by default)

**If you see black boxes:**
- Wait 2-3 seconds for cameras to initialize
- Make sure you granted camera permission
- Try closing and reopening the app

### Step 4: Test Recording (Main Feature!)
1. **Tap the red RECORD button** (large circle at bottom center)
   - Button should turn into a STOP button (square)
   - Timer should appear showing recording time (00:00, 00:01, etc.)
   - Status text should say "Recording..."

2. **Move around and test both cameras**
   - You should see yourself in the front camera preview
   - You should see what's behind you in the back camera preview
   - Both cameras are recording simultaneously!

3. **Tap the STOP button** to finish recording
   - Timer should disappear
   - Status should say "Recording stopped"
   - "Merge Videos" button should become enabled

### Step 5: Test Video Merging
After recording, you'll have two separate video files. Let's merge them:

1. **Tap "Merge Videos"** button
2. Choose a layout:
   - **Side-by-Side**: Both cameras shown equally side-by-side
   - **Picture-in-Picture**: Back camera as main view, front camera as small overlay

3. **Wait for processing**
   - You'll see a progress bar (0% ‚Üí 100%)
   - Status will show "Exporting video... X%"
   - This may take 10-30 seconds depending on video length

4. **Check Photos app**
   - When complete, status will say "Merged video saved to Photos!"
   - Open your Photos app
   - Find the newest video
   - Play it and verify both cameras are visible in the merged video

### Step 6: Test Additional Features

#### Quality Settings
1. Tap the **quality button** (top right, shows "1080p")
2. Select different quality:
   - **720p HD** - Good quality, smaller file size

   - **4K Ultra HD** - Best quality, largest file size
3. Record a video to test the selected quality

#### Zoom Feature

2. You can zoom each camera independently (1x to 5x zoom)
3. Zoom works during recording too!

#### Focus/Exposure
1. **Tap anywhere on a camera preview** to set focus point
2. You'll see a yellow circle animation
3. Camera will focus on that point

#### Flash
1. Tap the **flash button** (lightning bolt, left side)
2. Flash/torch toggles on the back camera
3. Try this in a dark room to see the effect

2. This swaps which camera is on top vs bottom
3. Useful for different shooting angles

#### Video Gallery
1. Tap the **gallery button** (top left, grid icon)
