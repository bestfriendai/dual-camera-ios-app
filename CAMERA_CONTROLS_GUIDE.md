1. **ZoomControl.swift** - Zoom UI component
2. **FocusExposureControl.swift** - Focus/Exposure system
3. **FlashControl.swift** - Flash mode control
4. **TimerControl.swift** - Self-timer control

**Steps to Add:**
1. Open DualCameraApp.xcodeproj in Xcode
2. Right-click on "DualCameraApp" folder
3. Select "Add Files to DualCameraApp..."
4. Select all 4 new files
5. Ensure "Copy items if needed" is checked
6. Click "Add"

## Technical Details

### Zoom Control
- Min zoom: 1.0×
- Max zoom: Lesser of 10× or device maximum
- Preset levels adapt to camera capabilities
- Smooth CGAffineTransform animations
- UISlider for fine control (0.1× precision)

### Focus System
- Uses AVCaptureDevice focus point of interest
- Converts UI coordinates to device coordinates
- Portrait orientation support
- Concurrent focus and exposure
- Auto-reset to continuous autofocus

### Flash Control
- AVCaptureDevice.FlashMode integration
- Supports: off, on, auto
- Device capability checking
- Applies to compatible cameras only
- State persistence during session

### Timer Functionality
- NSTimer-based countdown
- HapticFeedbackManager integration
- Visual countdown (3s, 10s options)
- Automatic recording start
- Cancellable during countdown

## Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Control Initialization**: Controls setup after camera ready
- **Efficient Gesture Handling**: Minimal overhead for tap-to-focus
- **Adaptive Zoom**: Max zoom calculated from device capabilities
- **Background Queue Processing**: Focus/exposure on background thread
- **Smart UI Updates**: Only update visible elements

## Integration Points

### ViewController Updates
- Added control properties and gesture handlers
- Integrated with DualCameraManager
- Setup in `didFinishCameraSetup()`
- Constraint-based layout
- Delegate pattern for callbacks

### Camera Manager Integration
- Direct AVCaptureDevice manipulation
- Configuration locking for thread safety
- Error handling for unsupported features
- State synchronization

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- [ ] White balance control
- [ ] ISO/Shutter speed manual mode
- [ ] Focus peaking visualization
- [ ] Zebra stripes for exposure
- [ ] Histogram display
- [ ] HDR mode toggle
- [ ] Night mode
- [ ] RAW capture support
- [ ] Custom aspect ratios
- [ ] Level indicator

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Zoom not working:**
- Verify camera device is available
- Check maxZoomFactor > 1.0
- Ensure lockForConfiguration succeeds

**Focus indicator not showing:**
- Check gesture recognizer is added
- Verify preview view bounds are set
- Ensure focus control alpha > 0

**Flash control disabled:**
- Check device.hasFlash
- Verify flash mode support
- Check camera permissions

**Timer countdown not starting:**
- Verify timer duration is set
- Check Timer initialization
- Ensure main thread updates

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Zoom works on both cameras
- [ ] Tap-to-focus shows indicator
- [ ] Flash modes cycle correctly
- [ ] Timer counts down properly
- [ ] Recording timer displays
- [ ] All controls have blur backgrounds
- [ ] Haptic feedback works
- [ ] Constraints layout properly on all devices
- [ ] Controls hide/show appropriately
- [ ] Performance remains smooth
