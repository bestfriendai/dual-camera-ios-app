## Swift 6.2 Concurrency Enhancements

### Distributed Actors Implementation

We've implemented distributed actors throughout the application to improve concurrency and performance:

- **SystemCoordinator**: Now a distributed actor that manages all system components with strict concurrency compliance
- **MemoryManager**: Enhanced with distributed actor support for better memory management across threads
- **HardwareSynchronizer**: Implemented as a distributed actor for improved multi-camera synchronization
- **DynamicIslandManager**: Created as a distributed actor for Dynamic Island integration
- **AppIntentsManager**: Implemented as a distributed actor for Siri integration

### Strict Sendable Compliance

All data structures and protocols now conform to `Sendable` for safe concurrent access:

```swift
// Example of Sendable compliance
struct SystemStatus: Sendable {
    let isInitialized: Bool
    let systemHealth: SystemHealth
    // ... other properties
}
```

### Task Groups for Concurrent Operations

We've replaced sequential operations with task groups for better performance:

```swift
// Example of task groups usage
try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group in
    group.addTask {
        // Concurrent operation 1
    }
    group.addTask {
        // Concurrent operation 2
    }
}
```
